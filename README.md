# Nebula Social Media App

this is a full stack social media app that i built using react and css for the front end, NodeJs for the back end while using MSA,
and mssql for the database. The app has interesting features such as the search, posting of pictures, liking of posts, a notifications page,
and the theme switcher to add on user experience among others.
Proper error handling and user communication and response were very key for this project.
